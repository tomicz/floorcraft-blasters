# Floorcraft: Blasters

A multiplayer augmented reality racing game built with Unity, featuring real-time spatial multiplayer powered by Auki's Posemesh SDK, Web3 wallet integration, and NFT support.

## Features

- **AR Foundation** - Cross-platform AR for iOS and Android
- **Spatial Multiplayer** - Share AR experiences using Auki's Posemesh (ConjureKit, Manna, Grund)
- **Domain Sessions** - Join persistent shared AR spaces via QR codes
- **Web3 Integration** - Wallet connectivity via Reown (WalletConnect)
- **NFT Support** - ERC-1155 token ownership verification on Base blockchain
- **Multiple Game Modes**:
  - Free For All - Solo racing
  - Join Session - Multiplayer via QR code
  - Mayhem Mode - PvE with AI enemies

## Paid Assets (optional)

The official builds use two paid assets that are not included here: AVPro Movie
Capture (video recording) and the EffectCore explosion pack (particle materials).
The project compiles and runs without them; recording is disabled and the
affected particles show missing materials. Licensed developers can install them
with `tools/paid-assets.sh install`. See [Docs/PaidAssets.md](Docs/PaidAssets.md).

### First Run Checklist

- [ ] Unity version 2022.3.62f2 installed
- [ ] Project opens without errors
- [ ] Auki App Key and App Secret configured
- [ ] Amplitude analytics key configured
- [ ] AR-capable device available for testing
- [ ] Build successfully deploys to device
- [ ] AR camera activates on device launch

### Troubleshooting

**"Missing interface binding" errors:**

- Check that all API keys are filled in `Blasters Configs`
- Restart Unity after configuration changes

**AR camera shows black screen:**

- Ensure you're running on a real device (not simulator/editor)
- Check camera permissions in device settings

**Multiplayer connection fails:**

- Verify Auki App Key and App Secret are correct
- Check device internet connection
- Ensure you're on the correct build environment (staging/prod)

**Build errors on iOS/Android:**

- Verify minimum OS versions meet requirements
- Check that AR Foundation and ARCore/ARKit XR Plugins are installed

## Configuration Details

The `_matterless/Data` folder contains configurations, some of which you'll need to update with your own information.

- `Blasters Configs` and `Floorcraft Configs` hold configurations for privacy policy, terms of services, Auki posemesh app key, secret and domain id
- `Backtrace Configuration` has the settings for [https://backtrace.io/](https://backtrace.io/).
- `Blasters Environment Settings` contains API Key settings for [https://www.getjoystick.com/](https://www.getjoystick.com/).

You will also need an [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) App key in `AnalyticsService.cs` (`m_Amplitude.init("YOUR_AMPLITUDE_ID");`) for tracking analytics.

## Wallet Integration with Reown WalletConnect

This project uses [Reown (formerly WalletConnect)](https://reown.com/) for blockchain wallet connectivity. To set up wallet functionality:

1. **Get your Reown Project ID:**

   - Visit [https://cloud.reown.com](https://cloud.reown.com)
   - Create a free account or sign in
   - Create a new project and copy your Project ID

2. **Configure in Unity:**
   - Open Unity Editor
   - Navigate to `Assets/_matterless/Data/`
   - Select `Blasters Configs`
   - In the Inspector, find the "Wallet Settings" section
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual information:
     - **Project ID:** Your Reown Project ID from step 1
     - **Project Name:** Your application name
     - **Project Description:** Brief description of your app
     - **Project URL:** Your project website
     - **Project Icon URL:** URL to your app icon (recommended size: 512x512px)

## NFT Integration with ERC-1155

This project includes NFT (Non-Fungible Token) integration using [Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/) and JSON-RPC fallbacks for reading ERC-1155 tokens on the Base blockchain. The implementation is read-only (no transactions), making it safe and free to use on mainnet.

1. **Get your Alchemy API Key:**

   - Visit [https://alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com)
   - Create a free account or sign in
   - Create a new App and select "Base" as the network
   - Copy your API Key from the dashboard

2. **Configure in Unity:**

   - Open Unity Editor
   - Navigate to `Assets/_matterless/Data/`
   - Select `Blasters Configs`
   - In the Inspector, find the "Chain Settings" section
   - Replace the placeholder values:
     - **NFT Contract Address:** Your ERC-1155 contract address on Base blockchain (e.g., `0x1234...`)
     - **RPC Endpoint:** Keep as `https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/`
     - **API Key:** Your Alchemy API Key from step 1

3. **Features:**

   - Check ownership of specific token IDs (per-vehicle gating)
   - Retrieve token metadata URIs (supports `{id}` replacement and IPFS gateways)
   - Load NFT images from metadata for UI display
   - Read-only operations (no gas fees or transactions)

4. **Usage in Code:**
   ```csharp
   // NFTService is available through dependency injection
   bool owns = await nftService.OwnsToken(walletAddress, tokenId);
   string tokenURI = await nftService.GetTokenURI(tokenId);
   var sprite = await nftService.LoadNFTImage(tokenId);
   ```

## Important Security Note

**Never commit your actual API keys to the repository.** The config files should remain with placeholder text in version control. Only fill in real values in your local development environment. This applies to:

- Auki posemesh App Key and Secret
- Reown WalletConnect Project ID
- Alchemy API Key (for NFT/blockchain access)
- Backtrace API settings
- Joystick API Key
- Amplitude App Key

## Removed Dependencies

The original project had dependencies on two paid assets which were removed from the open-source version:

- [Effectcore Stylized Explosion Pack 1](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/stylized-explosion-pack-1-79037) for explosion effects.
- [AVPro Movie Capture](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/video/avpro-movie-capture-mobile-edition-221852) for recording functionality.

The project also has Unity package manager dependencies to the following repositories

- [https://github.com/matterless/audio-module](https://github.com/matterless/audio-module)
- [https://github.com/matterless/localisation-module](https://github.com/matterless/localisation-module)
- [https://github.com/matterless/inject-module](https://github.com/matterless/inject-module)
