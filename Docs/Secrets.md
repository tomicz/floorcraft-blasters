# Secrets

API keys are never committed. They live in a `.env` file at the project root,
which the Unity editor turns into a generated `AppSecrets` asset that ships in
the build. Both files are gitignored.

| Variable | Used by | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `AUKI_APP_KEY`, `AUKI_APP_SECRET` | Auki posemesh session and DDS authentication | [Auki Console](https://console.auki.network) |
| `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` | Analytics | [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com) |
| `REOWN_PROJECT_ID` | Wallet connection (Reown AppKit) | [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com) |
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` | NFT ownership checks on Base | [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) |

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in the values
tools/paid-assets.sh hook   # optional: installs the pre-push guard described below
```

`.env` is a plain `KEY=VALUE` file. Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored,
values may be quoted, and a leading `export ` is accepted.

Open the project in Unity. `SecretsSync` (an editor script in
`Assets/_matterless/Scripts/Editor`) reads `.env` whenever scripts reload,
before every build, and from **Matterless > Secrets > Sync from .env**, and
writes `Assets/_matterless/Resources/AppSecrets.asset`. The console logs
`[Secrets] ... updated from .env` when the asset changes. Process environment
variables with the same names override `.env`, which is how CI supplies them.

## How the values reach the code

At runtime `RootInstaller` calls `AppSecrets.Load()`, which loads the asset from
`Resources`, and passes it to `AppConfigs.ApplySecrets`. That pushes each value
into a non-serialized field of the settings object that needs it:

| Value | Settings object | Accessor |
|---|---|---|
| Auki app key and secret | `AukiSettings` | `appKey`, `appSecret` |
| Amplitude API key | `AnalyticsSettings` | `amplitudeApiKey` |
| Reown project id | `WalletSettings` | `projectId` |
| Alchemy API key | `ChainSettings` | `apiKey`, `rpcUrl` |

Because the receiving fields are not serialized, nothing is ever written back
into the tracked config assets, and services keep reading the same accessors
they always did.

## Without secrets

The project compiles and runs. `AppSecrets.Load()` logs one error naming this
document, and each feature that needs a key logs its own warning and stays
disabled: no Auki session, no analytics, no wallet, no NFT checks.

## Guard rails

- `.env`, `AppSecrets.asset`, and its meta file are gitignored.
- The pre-push hook installed by `tools/paid-assets.sh hook` refuses to push a
  commit that contains those files, or a config asset where one of the former
  key fields still carries a value. Run `tools/paid-assets.sh check` to scan
  unpushed commits by hand.

## Adding a new secret

1. Add the variable to `.env.example` and to your `.env`.
2. Add a serialized field and accessor to `AppSecrets`, and the mapping in
   `SecretsSync.s_Keys`.
3. Give the consuming settings class a non-serialized field plus a `SetSecrets`
   method, and wire it in `AppConfigs.ApplySecrets`.
4. If the value previously lived in a config asset, add its field name to
   `SECRET_FIELDS` in `tools/githooks/pre-push`.
